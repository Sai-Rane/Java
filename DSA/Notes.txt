Data Structure is way to store and organize data efficiently

Efficiently means in terms of Performance and Memory.
You build an Application through Algorithms(Set of instructions).

Time Complexity->Measure of how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of input data
It should take less Time

Space Complexity
It should take less space in Memory

Suppose you want to search an element in a sorted array
There are multiple solutions for it. For example:Linear Search,Binary Search

In Linear Search we traverse through the array from start
In Binary search you divide your array into two parts.For dividing the array you need to find mid part of array
Adv of Binary Search is number of operation you do is less
